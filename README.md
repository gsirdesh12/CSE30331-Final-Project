# CSE30331-Final-Project

Gaurav Sirdeshpande (gsirdesh)

This project implements a binary heap in both C++ and Java programming languages.

To run programs:

C++ Binary Heap Implementation: 
    Run make, then ./binary_heap

Java Binary Heap Implementation: 
    Compile program with javac BinaryHeap.java
    Run program with java BinaryHeap


Benchmarking

What was surprising is that, from the results above it can be seen that Java was actually faster than C++ in this implementation. This could be because Java uses the JIT (just in time) compiler which basically queries the machine to optimize on runtime. C++ usually compiles beforehand using a combination of optimizations so that it can run on anything.
